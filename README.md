# Bulk Image Manipulation Tool

The project aims to develop a cross-platform bulk image manipulation tool using C++ and the Qt framework. It will feature a user-friendly graphical interface with advanced capabilities like auto-white balance, color correction, noise reduction, and batch processing. By integrating the OpenCV library for image processing, the tool will enable efficient editing operations such as resizing, cropping, format conversion, and undoing and redoing multiple images simultaneously. This comprehensive solution will streamline image editing workflows, enhancing productivity and output quality for professionals and enthusiasts in fields like digital marketing, photography, and graphic design.
