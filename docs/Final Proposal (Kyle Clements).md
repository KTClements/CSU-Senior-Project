### Problem Statement 
In the digital era, image manipulation is a vital tool for professionals and enthusiasts alike. The ideal state involves having efficient, user-friendly tools that can handle bulk image processing tasks with ease. Currently, while there are tools like Fotosizer available, they often lack advanced features such as auto white balance, limiting the scope of batch processing capabilities. This problem is significant as it affects productivity in various sectors, including digital marketing, photography, and graphic design. An improved tool would not only enhance efficiency but also ensure higher quality outcomes. Therefore, I propose the development of a bulk image manipulation tool that integrates advanced features like auto white balance. This solution will streamline the image editing process, saving time and improving the overall quality of the output. In conclusion, the idea of this tool could really make a difference by filling the gaps we currently see in bulk image editing software.


### Project Description 
The project involves developing cross-platform bulk image manipulation software using the Qt C++ framework. This will feature a graphical user interface with a central image preview area and toolbars on both sides for common operations. An advanced settings panel at the top will allow for fine-tuning parameters such as auto-white balance, color correction, contrast adjustment, and noise reduction. Additionally, a batch processing queue will enable the application of the same set of operations to multiple images simultaneously. The application will run across various operating systems, enhancing the user's productivity and output quality in image processing tasks. Some key features include resizing, cropping, format conversion, advanced color correction tools, and undo/redo functionality. As a result, these will allow for cleaner outputs and conversions between JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP, in addition to correcting errors in the software.


### Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
*Primary Language:* C++


### Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s)
- Qt framework for User Interface design and implementation.
- OpenCV library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- Boost library for C++ utilities and functionalities.


### Additional Software/Equipment Needed 
- Visual Studio Code or similar IDE.
- GitHub.


### Personal Motivation 
This project will allow me to apply my knowledge in C++, integrating them with practical applications in image processing. It will deepen my understanding of software development, user interface design, and the utilization of libraries like OpenCV and Qt. This hands-on experience is crucial for my aspiration to become a software developer specializing in media processing tools.


### Outline of Future Research Efforts 
The project will begin with a comprehensive study of existing bulk image manipulation tools to identify their limitations. Subsequent research efforts will focus on advanced image processing techniques, especially auto-white balance algorithms, as well as learning the Qt framework through relevant tutorials. If deemed necessary, research on the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks may also be conducted. Deliverables will include a functional prototype, followed by iterative improvements based on user feedback and testing.
